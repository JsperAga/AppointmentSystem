Basic ASP.Net C# MVC 4.7.2 API Web Application

I have developed this web application based on the collaborative project between Seneca College and Prosper Canada. The application is a product of my understanding and effort in relation to our shared project goals and objectives.

It's important to clarify that I undertook this project independently after our team had already submitted our original project to Prosper Canada. The purpose of creating this web application was primarily for the purpose of review and further exploration of the concepts and ideas we had worked on during the initial project.

This web application represents my individual contribution and initiative to delve deeper into the project's subject matter. While it was initiated independently, it remains aligned with the overarching goals and objectives of our collaborative effort with Seneca College and Prosper Canada.

The aim of this endeavor is to enhance our understanding of the project's core concepts and potentially identify areas for improvement or refinement based on my individual perspective and insights gained through this independent work. This web application is a testament to my dedication and commitment to the project's success and my ongoing commitment to its objectives.

This is the only ASP.Net C# project I can share on my GitHub due to confidentiality agreements with my previous employers.
